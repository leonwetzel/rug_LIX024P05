This repository contains code for Milestone 5 of the course Introduction to Research Methods, taught at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Groningen. The course is part of the Information Science program.

The software in this repository can be used to determine how frequent the Dutch article '*de*' occurs on the Dutch Wikipedia page of the University of Groningen (which can be found [here](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksuniversiteit_Groningen)). The application downloads the actual web page itself; the user does not have to manually feed the web page to the application! The generated results indicate how often 'de' appears in the downloaded corpus.

## How to use
1. Download `sample.sh` or clone the entire repository.
2. Open a Command Line Interface (CLI) or terminal environment.
3. Head to the directory in which `sample.sh` is located.
4. Run the script by performing `sh sample.sh`.
